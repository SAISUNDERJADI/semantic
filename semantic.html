                RAMAPPA TEMPLE
                <p><b>The magnificent structure of Ramappa Temple is situated about 77 kilometres away from the main city of Warangal, right in the heart of the ancient capital of the Kakatiya Dynasty. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple is believed to have been constructed over a period of 40 years. It was built by General Recherla Rudra during the period of the Kakatiya ruler Ganapati Deva. The edifice of Ramappa Temple is an exquisite example of Kakatiya style of design and is covered in detailed carvings that depict the life in the olden times. The intricate architecture and mighty foundation has stood the test of time and is a wonderful look into the culture and history of Hyderabad.</b></p>
                <p><b>Also known as the Ramalingeswara temple, it derives its name from the sculptor Ramappa who built the statue of Shiva and started the worship of the deity here. As you enter the premises, you are welcomed by two delicate statues of dancers striking graceful poses. A massive 9 feet Shivalinga is enshrined in the temple and is the main deity here as well. Two other smaller Shiva shrines can also be found on either side of the main temple, although both are in ruins. The Nandi inside the temple appears to be alert, ready to follow the order of the lord and has survived the test of time.</b></p>
                <p><b>The Ramappa Temple dates back to 1213 AD and was built by Chief Commander Rudra Samani under the authority of Kakatiya ruler Kakati Ganapathi Deva. The temple derives its name from the sculptor Ramappa who built the statue of Shiva here and highlighted the importance of the worship of the deity, thus superseding the preceding deity Ramalingeshwara. The construction of the temple saw completion in the year 1253, forty years after it first began.</b></p>
